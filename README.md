# libcmdbm

## 1. About

libcmdbm is a database wrapper library with object based approach.

To build database application in C, there are many complex jobs to do.

* If query has to be changed, application must be recoompiled.
* If database migration is needed, almost whole program must be recreated.
* If there are multiple types of database, need to use different library API
for each database types.

This library is much like with MyBatis java library.

The libcmdbm library :

* has intuitive structure to use like OOP language
* runs on almost every platforms
* supports Oracle, MySQL, PgSQL and ODBC basically out of box,
    and any database can be added by creating interface module.
* offers same API with different database type.
* supports connecting to multiple databases.
* connection pooling implemented by default.
* uses dynamic query building by XML query files.

libcmdbm is developed and maintained by Dennis Soungjin Park <xcomart@gmail.com>.
